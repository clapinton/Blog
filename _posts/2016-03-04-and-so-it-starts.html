<h1>Starting a blog...</h1>
<p>There's more than one reason as to why I'm doing this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I want to try and capture one piece of new information I learn throughout the day. It can be small, such as learning a new climbing move. Or something a bit more complex (at least to me), such as setting up a blog. I'll try to add one per day, but that'll depend on the complexeity of the subject;</li>
	<li>I want to start a new personal project. I've been looking for something to do for some time now, and I may have found it. Time will tell;</li>
	<li>I enjoy coding and wanted to try new languages/technologies. So, why not setting up the blog myself, instead of a ready-to-use Blogger? I wanted to have the pieces and be able to connect them, so I would learn by doing (which is how I learn anyway);</li>
</ul>

<h2>So, who am I writing to?</h2>
<p>Mainly, myself. I can write in English or Portuguese, if I want to share with my friends back in Brazil.
But in the end, I'll take this as a journal. A diary. I had one when I was little. Crammed a whole bunch of pictures in it. It was fun.
Let's see if I can do the same in a blog way.
</p>

<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>Well, the major pieces are in. The blog is there. Jakyll is set up (which I'll write about next). Github is working. And I'm writing
	this in HTML format, since I have no idea how to do it in Markup. Yet. So now, it's all about styling the thing as I want it, while documenting it on the place that I'm styling. Basically, I'll start by building a platform in order to write how I built the platform I'm writing on. In the process, I'm hoping to learn some Markup and finally get the hang of vim.</p>
