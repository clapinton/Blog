Last week, my friend Mateus Interciso sent me this link about Einstein@Home, which is a BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) project where you can help researchers find new neutron stars, by using your own computer's idle time to analyze sensors' data. Basically, it's crowdsourcing science. Why not?

All you have to do is download the BOINC software from <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php" target="_blank">their site</a> and point it to the project's URL, <a href="http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/" target="_blank">http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/</a>. It's really straightforward.

It's worth noting that you have full control over power and CPU consumption. You can configure when the computer should do the work, as well as limit the amount of processor time and memory it should use.

If you're more of a particle than a wave person, you can also contribute to the ATLAS project, which is one of the large detectors at CERN.

If you're either or, pretty much like light itself, then just go for it!

If doing good for science is not your thing, then do it for the spinning screensaver:
