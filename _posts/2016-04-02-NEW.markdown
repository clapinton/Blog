Ok, so what should I do with these? Well, I'm on a plain, white canvas with some plain, colored shapes. What if I got these shapes out of the plane and made them look like a 3D shape? Even better: what if it was an optical illusion? Color illusions can be done on a 2D plane, but I want to try and add the z dimension and have some interesting illusions instead. I can start feeling some Escher-type of thing taking shape. That could work! Let's start with a basic illusion: the Penrose Triangle, by Oscar Reutersv√§rd.

So here's an issue: these illusions rely on shades and, sometimes, shadows. Shadows are gradients and I don't have shades of the same color here. Maybe it'll work with the Google colors? Turns out, it does work:

Great! So let's make one of these! And after that, I'm going to work on another shape:

Or so I thought... It turns out that the triangle was fairly easy, but the circle... Well, let's just say it was enough to make me give up on this idea.

So, what now...?


##Maybe try and focus on the animation bit...

Let's talk about another feature here: animation. I have 10 frames to work with, meaning I can do an animation. Well, sort of. The animation happen between frames only, meaning they're more of a transition than an animation per se. So I'd have to think in terms of scenes and transition between them
